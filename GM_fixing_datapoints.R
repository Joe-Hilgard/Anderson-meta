#  dependency within dyads not modeled.
# Drops the violent-prosocial condition, so no multiple comparisons here.
# "In fact, the means for antisocial video games were
# least aggressive (M = 1.87, SD = 0.61) compared to either the prosocial
# violent (M = 2.15, SD = 0.89) or non-violent (M = 1.91, SD = 0.90) games. 
# Neither covariate was statistically significant,
