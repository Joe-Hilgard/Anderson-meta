I think that:
High cook's distance with positive standardized residuals make the line more positively sloped
High cook's distance with negative standardized residuals make the line more negatively sloped
potential cutoffs are D > 1 or D > (4/n)

AggAff, Exp, best:
Whopping effect size from Ballard & Weist (1996) of r = .87(!) has substantial d (d=0.75 or so)
This leverage is reduced somewhat when not-best studies are included.
Deleting this point leads to lesser slope but still sig bias and nonsig effect (r = -.03)

AggAff, NonExp, best:
Yukawa & Sakamoto (2001) has fairly large distance (d=0.55) 
Matsuzaki et al (2004) unusual in that reports negative effect (r = -.07)
Deleting Y&S(2001) leads to significant effect (r = .10)

notbest:
some distance on Uozumi (2006) (r=.29, d=.5) and Urashima&Suzuki (r=.54, d = .45) for large effect at large precision
Deleting Uozumi (2006) retains nonsig effect and nonsig bias but reduces effect (r = .06)

AggBeh, Exp, Best:
one observation with high leverage but I can't tell which it is or why. Seems every obs should have comparable leverage due to modest range on Std.Err? Is it Anderson Gentile Buckley (2007)?
Anyway, no high-distance points.

AggBeh, Exp, all:
not much cook's D despite some large standardized residuals (e.g. r = -.2 from Meyers (2003))
Remember that Panee & Ballard (2002) uses invalid measure of aggressive behavior
Deleting that reduces the bias somewhat and increases effect (r = .14, p = .007)
NEED PEESE B/C OF SIG EFFECT

AggBeh, Nonexperimental, Best:
Big distance (d = ~.8) on Matsuzaki et al (2004)
Deleting it doesn't do much to the slope but does reduce effect size estimate (r = .27)
NEED PEESE B/C OF SIG EFFECT

AggBeh, Nonexperimental, All:
One obs with large cook's d (d = .55) and negative residual
Matsuzaki in here twice with highly similar effect sizes, guessing one is correlation with violent games vs other is correlation with all games.
Removing Matsuzaki reveals sig bias but retains sig effect (r = .16)
NEED PEESE B/C OF SIG EFFECT

AggCog, Exp:
Some big standardized residuals but not a lot of distance... Going with r = .11 and r = .21 on this one

AggCog, Longitudinal, Best:
This is a small sample so it's probably best left alone. Distance for one point is so huge it's off the chart.

AggCog, Nonexperimental, Best:
Matsuzaki et al (2004) again with a distance > 1, something very strange about that study. Still has huge distance in not-best, too.
There's a high-leverage negative-residual study with distance = 0.5, too.
Removing Matsuzaki et al (2004) retains sig effect but shrinks it (r=.12), makes ACF04AC4b have big distance (d=.8)
Removing Anderson et al (2004) for big distance retains sig effect but shrinks it further (r=.08), reveals sig. bias.
NEED PEESE B/C OF SIG EFFECT

AggCog, Nonexperimental, All:
Again removing Matsuzaki et al (2004) for huge distance...
r shrinks to .12 but still sig, still NEED PEESE B/C OF SIG EFFECT
After that, some big residuals but no big distance


Desensitization, Empathy, all bets are off due to tiny N

PhysArous Experiments Best look ok but not sig either b0 or b1
PhysArous Experiments All has nonsig b0 or b1 but r very near zero

ProsBeh Exp Best: Tiny N = 4, hilarious conclusion of true positive relationship
Adding not-best leads to smaller distances, flatter slope, r=-.15, still not sig

ProsBeh Nonexp Best/NotBest: Slope indicates bias although not significant until not-best studies included. No sig b0. 
However, huge distance on Uozumi (2006) among not-best. Removing this study leads to stronger bias, less negative effect size b0.

And that's it!
