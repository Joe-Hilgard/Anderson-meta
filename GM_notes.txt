General CMA notes:
- Multiple subgroups can be imputed across to create a "combined" estimate
  I believe this sums the Ns and makes a weighted average effect size.
- For multiple outcomes, CMA allows the following options:
  - Use the mean of all outcomes
  - Use each outcome, assuming independence
  - Use the first outcome available based on some sequence
- I wonder which settings Craig used? Which settings G&M used?

Krahe & Moller, 2011
-Aggressive behavior male & female have been reversed.
Was male r = .17, female r = .09,
Should be male r = .09, female r = .17.
-Each simple slope is entered as having N=1688, 
rather than 837 for females and 851 for males.
It may be a problem because CMA will impute a
"Combined" sample with too much precision (CMA manual, p 52).
It may not be a problem because CMA will average, not sum, for outcomes.
--However, note that it's impossible to reproduce which 
  checkboxes were ticked (CMA manual, p. 54)
-Should prosocial behavior be entered as negative?

I'm having trouble finding the "teacher-rated aggression" outcome at timepoint T1 r = -.09

Anderson & Carnagey, 2011
"High intensity aggression" is coming up with SE =.343, N=11.5, which surely isn't right

Krcmar & Lachlan, 2009
Apparent Ns vary across outcomes within a condition by as much as 10-20 n
Ns seem a little too high (e.g. 61 instead of 58 for 30min, 82 instead of 57 for 10min)
Entering each pairwise effect size w/r/t control group with precision of 60+, 80+ seems to maybe over-count control group? Because subgroup-within-study is summed across. so a study of N=173 will end up entered as N=250+


Sometimes Subgroup.within.study needs combining samples (e.g. Valadez & Ferguson, 2012) and sometimes it doesn't (e.g. Anderson & Carnagey?).
Ewoldsen?
