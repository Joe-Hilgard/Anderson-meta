AggAff:
-Fischer et al. 2012 S2 is outlier among AggAff experiments. Is the sign wrong?
-Shafer (2012) and Saleem&Anderson have largest sample sizes: accurate?

Arousal:
-Krcmar et al is all wrong, huge r and huge n due to clumsy combination of pairwise comparisons
-lots of heterogeneity, need to check it out
-when I combine Arriaga by hand I get .346 not .379. May be something wrong happening in combine.rows()?

AggBeh:
- naive meta estimate is r=.25 which is much too large
- Hasan, Begue, & Bushman entered with "hostile expectation bias" (2012) as a form of aggressive behavior (bad!)
- Another enormous effect, Greitemeyer & McLatchie (2011) S2 "other player's aggressive behavior". Seems that they're trying to say "aggressive behavior towards other participant". ns for S1 seem a little off: not n=40, not n=60. S2 std.err is too small, reflects n=53 or n=57 instead of n=40. standard error is 10% smaller than it should be. "Other player's secondary emotion" cherry-picked for agg cog, human uniqueness / human nature stuff discarded.

12/28/14 notes

General CMA notes:
- Multiple subgroups can be imputed across to create a "combined" estimate
  I believe this sums the Ns and makes a weighted average effect size.
- For multiple outcomes, CMA allows the following options:
  - Use the mean of all outcomes
  - Use each outcome, assuming independence
  - Use the first outcome available based on some sequence
- I wonder which settings Craig used? Which settings G&M used?

Krahe & Moller, 2011
-Aggressive behavior male & female have been reversed.
Was male r = .17, female r = .09,
Should be male r = .09, female r = .17.
-Each simple slope is entered as having N=1688, 
rather than 837 for females and 851 for males.
It may be a problem because CMA will impute a
"Combined" sample with too much precision (CMA manual, p 52).
It may not be a problem because CMA will average, not sum, for outcomes.
--However, note that it's impossible to reproduce which 
  checkboxes were ticked (CMA manual, p. 54)
-Should prosocial behavior be entered as negative?

Krahe, Busching, Moller, 2012
I'm having trouble finding the "teacher-rated aggression" outcome at timepoint T1 r = -.09

Anderson & Carnagey, 2011
"High intensity aggression" is coming up with SE =.343, N=11.5, which surely isn't right

Krcmar & Lachlan, 2009
Apparent Ns vary across outcomes within a condition by as much as 10-20 n
Ns seem a little too high (e.g. 61 instead of 58 for 30min, 82 instead of 57 for 10min)
Entering each pairwise effect size w/r/t control group with precision of 60+, 80+ seems to maybe over-count control group? Because subgroup-within-study is summed across. so a study of N=173 will end up entered as N=250+


Sometimes Subgroup.within.study needs combining samples (e.g. Valadez & Ferguson, 2012) and sometimes it doesn't (e.g. Anderson & Carnagey?).
Ewoldsen?
