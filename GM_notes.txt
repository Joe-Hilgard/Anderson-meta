Krahe & Moller, 2011
-Aggressive behavior male & female have been reversed.
Was male r = .17, female r = .09,
Should be male r = .09, female r = .17.
-Each simple slope is entered as having N=1688, 
rather than 837 for females and 851 for males.
I think it is a problem because CMA will impute a
"Combined" sample with too much precision (CMA manual, p 52).
--However, note that it's impossible to reproduce which 
  checkboxes were ticked (CMA manual, p. 54)
-Should prosocial behavior be entered as negative?
